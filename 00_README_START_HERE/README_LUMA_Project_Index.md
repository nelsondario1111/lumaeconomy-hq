# LUMA Project HQ — Index (Start Here)

**Project:** LUMA — A Living Economy of Light  
**Base document:** *LUMA Whitepaper v1.0 (November 2025)*  
**Context:** Toronto-first, global-ready

## 1) What LUMA is (in one breath)

LUMA is a community-powered **mutual credit** system and **cultural protocol** for exchanging services, support, and digital creations through a symbolic unit called **LUMA** inside the **LUMA Lane** (non-monetary). Cash payments, when needed, happen separately in the **Fiat Lane** (Stripe/PayPal/transfer), outside the LUMA ledger.

**Culture reference:** 1 LUMA ≈ 1 minute of present, loving attention (≈ 60 LUMA/hour).  
**Formal definition:** LUMA is **not money**, **not pegged**, and **not redeemable for cash by the platform**.

## 3) Current phase & focus

**Current phase:** Phase 0 — Toronto Pilot (closed / small circle)  
**Primary focus now:** Build the **Pilot Pack** so LUMA can run real exchanges with minimal tech.

**Pilot Pack (must-have docs):**
1. Luminary Onboarding Guide (how to join + first steps)
2. Code of Conduct + Consent/Boundaries + Safety norms
3. Light Contract templates (1:1 / Project / Event)
4. Caps & Bands policy (soft limits + valuation guidelines)
5. Dispute & Repair flow (repair-first, documented)
6. Pilot Scope + Runbook + Simple Metrics + Feedback loop

---

## 4) Definition anchors (do not drift)

- **Dual-Lane Architecture**
  - **LUMA Lane:** symbolic mutual-credit ledger (no money moves)
  - **Fiat Lane:** external money tools for materials/rent/taxes (not tracked as LUMA)

- **Mutual Credit Logic**
  - When A helps B: A balance **+LUMA**, B balance **–LUMA**
  - System-wide: total positives ≈ total negatives (Σ balances ≈ 0)

- **Scope v1**
  - Included: services, events, digital creations
  - Excluded (for now): physical items, food/ingestibles, financial products

## 5) “What we build next” (nearest milestone)

**Nearest milestone:** Publish Phase 0 Pilot Pack + run first real exchanges.

**Next concrete steps (order):**
1. Create `06_PILOT_TORONTO_PHASE0/Pilot_Scope.md` (size, duration, rules, caps)
2. Create Light Contract templates in `04_LIGHT_CONTRACTS/Templates/`
3. Draft Culture + Safety docs in `02_CULTURE_PROTOCOL/`
4. Draft Dispute/Repair flow in `03_GOVERNANCE/` (or `04_LIGHT_CONTRACTS/` as ops)
5. Add simple metrics + feedback form to the Pilot folder
6. Only then: define MVP app requirements in `07_PRODUCT_APP/`

## 6) Decision Log (how we stay aligned)

All key decisions go in:  
`00_README_START_HERE/Decision_Log.md`

Use this format:
- **Date:**
- **Decision:**
- **Why:**
- **Impact / Follow-ups:**
- **Owner:**

---

## 7) How to contribute (working rhythm)

- Write docs **docs-first** (clarity before code).
- Keep language **simple, human, and consent-based**.
- If it affects culture, safety, LUMA definition, or lane separation → log it.
- Keep v1 narrow; add future lanes/modules only after stability.
